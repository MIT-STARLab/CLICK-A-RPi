Driver Installation

Nominally, you should just have to run the install script in the same directory as the mvBlueFOX tarball and it will run through the necssary installation process. Both of these are found in this directory, or at https://www.matrix-vision.com/USB2.0-single-board-camera-with-housing-mvbluefox-igc.html. However, it should be noted that if you are attempting to do this while ssh'd into the RPi Compute via a UART connection, the internet connection is exceedingly slow. This causes problems with apt-get, when it tries to access multiple mirror websites at once, as some of the mirror websites for the raspberry pi (ex: archive.raspbian.org) are located in the UK while others are in the US. The UK ones get throttled and timeout, so you get errors saying you have incorrect hash sizes. The solution to this problem is to identify the packages the install script was unable to get, and manually installing them using sudo apt-get install. This gives you a link to a debian package, which you then have to download on your primary computer, scp over to the RPi, dpkg -i this debian, then sudo apt-get install -f to install the previous debian package and all its dependencies. Once all of these problem children have been manually installed, run the install script again and it should sucessfully install the camera drivers for NODE.
